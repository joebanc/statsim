# STATSIM
**STATSIM** is a local data statistics and spatial data modeler and visualiser originally developed for [Community Based Monitoring System (CBMS)](https://www.pep-net.org/methods/cbms). 

# Evolution
It used to stand for statistics simulator but has expanded functions over time. Originally developed using C++, currently it is undergoing evolution to adapt to fast-changing analytics landscape, incorporating several up-to-date tools for visualisation, statistical methods, spatial analysis as well as AI particularly **R**.

# Way forward
CBMS has already been institutionalised and absorbed by government units and as such using their own fit-for-purpose tools. This tool is a legacy tool as reference and and springboard to different toolsets.
